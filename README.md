Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create the game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.
